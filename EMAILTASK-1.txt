Case 1: PRODSUP-001:

Hi. I am trying to get my test cases to show up on CircleCI but it is not working. I have a fork of this project
in my github account https://github.com/mtedone/podam. I added the project to CircleCI and got a green
build but the Test Results tab is empty

Hi Harry,

I went through the issue and below is what I could conclude. 

1. You have to add the circle.yml file with the below code.


test:
  post:
    - mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
    - find . -type f -regex ".*/target/surefire-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;



2. You need to enable "Maven Surefire Plugin" in pom.xml file by removing below code:

<configuration>
   <skip>true</skip>
</configuration>

Also, you have to remove the below code to git rid of the dependency errors.


<plugin>
	<groupId>com.github.github</groupId>
	<artifactId>site-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>0.12</version>
		<configuration>
			<message>Creating site for ${project.version}</message>
		</configuration>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<goals>
					<goal>site</goal>
				</goals>
				<phase>site</phase>
			</execution>
		</executions>
</plugin>
